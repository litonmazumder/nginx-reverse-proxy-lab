This project demonstrates a simple reverse proxy and load balancing setup using Nginx and Docker.

The reverse proxy routes incoming client requests to multiple backend services running in containers. This setup represents a common architecture used in modern DevOps environments.

## Architecture

Client requests are received by the Nginx reverse proxy, which forwards traffic to backend services using load balancing.
```
Client

Nginx Reverse Proxy

App1      App2
```
## Technologies Used

- Nginx

- Docker

- Docker Compose

- Linux

## Nginx Configuration

The Nginx reverse proxy forwards requests to backend containers using an upstream load balancing configuration.

## Example configuration:
```
events {}

http {

    upstream backend {
        server app1:80;
        server app2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }

}
```
This configuration distributes incoming traffic between multiple backend services.

## Docker Compose Setup

Backend services and the reverse proxy are deployed using Docker Compose.

## Example:
```
version: "3"

services:

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: reverse-proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - app1
      - app2

  app1:
    image: nginx

  app2:
    image: nginx
```
This creates a reverse proxy container and two backend service containers.
